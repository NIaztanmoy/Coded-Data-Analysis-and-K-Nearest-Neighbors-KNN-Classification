Project Title
Coded Data Analysis and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

Project Overview
This project explores a dataset with coded features to predict a binary outcome (Y or N). The primary objective was to build and evaluate a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model. The work involved a complete machine learning pipeline, from initial data preparation to model evaluation.

The key steps and outcomes of this project are:

Data Cleaning: The dataset was processed to ensure all features were in a suitable format for the machine learning model.

Feature Scaling: A MinMaxScaler was applied to standardize the range of the features. This is a crucial step for distance-based algorithms like KNN to ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance calculation.

Data Splitting: The dataset was divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Model Training and Evaluation: A KNN classifier was trained on the processed training data. The model's performance was then evaluated on the testing set, achieving a consistently high accuracy across multiple runs, with scores of 91%, 90%, and 92%.

This project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of supervised learning techniques and provides a solid foundation for further analysis and model improvement.
